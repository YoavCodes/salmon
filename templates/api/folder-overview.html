<h2>Application folder</h2>

<h3>config.json</h3>
<p>This is for storing server-side configuration settings, like the internal port node.js runs on, dev; staging; or production variables and so on.</p>

<h3>router.js</h3>
<p>This is the server router for routing requests to the node.js endpoint which defaults to <span class="prettyprint lang-bash">http://domain.com/0</span>. To facilliate routing you get three arguments <span class="prettyprint lang-bash">pathname</span>, <span class="prettyprint lang-bash">segments</span>, and <span class="prettyprint lang-bash">command</span>. <span class="prettyprint lang-bash">pathname</span> is the url path of the client-side app from where the request is originating: so if you loaded the page at <span class="prettyprint lang-bash">http://domain.com/test_app/</span>, the <span class="prettyprint lang-bash">pathname</span> will automatically be set to <span class="prettyprint lang-bash">test_app</span>. <span class="prettyprint lang-bash">segments</span> is a slash separated string like <span class="prettyprint lang-bash">"blog/posts"</span> which can be sent as a post variable to facilitate routing, <span class="prettyprint lang-bash">segments</span> is automatically split by the slash character into an array of segments. Finally the <span class="prettyprint lang-bash">command</span> argument can also be passed and used.</p>

<h2>Conf folder</h2>
<p>This stores configuration data for your server setup, the default Vagrant install comes with nginx and mongodb. When you run <span class="prettyprint lang-bash">vagrant up</span> it iterates over the <span class="prettyprint lang-bash">mongodb</span> folder creating and loading the databases with bson collections. Neither nginx nor mongodb are required to use HighFin.js, and you can configure your own server as your project require. You don't even need node and can just use fin.js to enhance your front-end apps. It's up to you.</p>

<h2>Node folder</h2>
<h3>node_modules</h3>
<p><span class="prettyprint lang-bash">node_modules</span> is for storing your node.js dependencies</p>

<h3>high.js</h3>
<p><span class="prettyprint lang-bash">high.js</span> is the server-side HighFin framework for node. If using node.js on the server you would run this to serve templates, compile LESS, handle caching, form submissions, database access, and JSON endpoint reponses. <span class="prettyprint lang-bash">high.js</span> is configured and extended in the <span class="prettyprint lang-bash">application</span> folder described above.</p>

<h3>package.json</h3>
<p>This is where you specify node dependencies that aren't in the node_modules folder, which would be retrieved and automatically configured when running <span class="prettyprint lang-bash">vagrant up</span> for the first time or after a <span class="prettyprint lang-bash">vagrant destroy</span>.</p>

<h2>Public folder</h2>
<p>This folder is public (clearly). Files and folders here are accessible at <span class="prettyprint lang-bash">http://domain.com/files_and_folders</span>. You may need to configure this in your server setup, the VM included with the project uses nginx with certain folders already configured, you can see that in <span class="prettyprint lang-bash">conf/dev/etc/nginx/sites-available/highfin-def.conf</span> </p>

<h3>Assets</h3>
<p>This is where your public assets are stored, anything from images to css, fonts, flash, or javascript. Anything you plan on referencing in your apps.</p>

<h3>index.html</h3>
<p>The nginx configuration is setup so <span class="prettyprint lang-bash">index.html</span> pages are loaded when you request the folder. So <span class="prettyprint lang-bash">http://domain.com/</span> will load <span class="prettyprint lang-bash">index.html</span> and <span class="prettyprint lang-bash">http://domain.com/test_app/</span> will load <span class="prettyprint lang-bash">public/test_app/index.html</span> while preserving a clean looking url. You could have any other html file and load them by name like <span class="prettyprint lang-bash">http://domain.com/whatever.html</span> or whatever else floats your boat.</p>

<p>I prefer to have separate apps in different html files, where an app is defined as a page with a specific design that has a specific purpose and loads different templates. So I might have a homepage in the root <span class="prettyprint lang-bash">index.html</span> file, a blog in <span class="prettyprint lang-bash">/blog/index.html</span> and so on. Ideally (and this is just a personal preference) I prefer loading an app as I've just described and then the only thing coming accross the wire as you navigate the app are JSON responses to database calls &mdash; but it depends on what you're doing and you can mix and match as needed.</p>

<p>The index.html files are also where you instantiate HighFin on the front-end.</p>

<h2>Templates folder</h2>
<p>This folder is for front-end templates and javascript. While you could put your front-end javascript files in the <span class="prettyprint lang-bash">public/assets/js/</span> folder, there are some benefits to putting it here. The folder structure ties into how the templates and javascript functions are namespaced, so if you had a blog at <span class="prettyprint lang-bash">http://domain.com/blog/</span> you may want to put all your blog templates in <span class="prettyprint lang-bash">templates/blog/</span>.</p>

<p>In general they're blocks of html or special javascript which are cached on the front-end (or sent as needed) and can be rendered over and over again, nested, and grouped; and because they have access to the front-end datastore so can show dynamic data and once rendered to anything normal front-end code would do.</p>

<p>In a client driven app instead of reloading the entire page when you navigate, you would just render different content into some container element to change the page without reloading.</p>

<h3>.js files</h3>
<p>In the templates folder, <span class="prettyprint lang-bash">.js</span> files are javascript template files. You would use a <span class="prettyprint lang-bash">.js</span> template when speed of rendering is a concern, or when a template requires a lot of logic and/or DOM manipulation.</p>

<h3>.html files</h3>
<p>In the templates folder, <span class="prettyprint lang-bash">.html</span> files are html template files. You would use an <span class="prettyprint lang-bash">.html</span> template when you don't care about a few milliseconds added in render time, when you're quickly prototyping a layout and haven't become familiar with <span class="prettyprint lang-bash">.js</span> templates, or if the content is very text heavy with lots of html formatting.</p>

<h3>.fn.js files</h3>
<p>In the templates folder, <span class="prettyprint lang-bash">.fn.js</span> files are for namespacing client-side javascript. Javascript written in these files is run when the template is cached on the front-end (typically as you instantiate HighFin). Other functions can be namespaced using an <span class="prettyprint lang-bash">Exports</span> syntax similar to node.js modules. If you had a bunch of public functions for your blog, you'd put them in <span class="prettyprint lang-bash">templates/blog/posts.fn.js</span></p>

<h2>Vagrant</h2>
<p>While you don't require a virtual machine(vm) to use HighFin, it's recommended to use a vm for development because when you run into problems because you're developing on a different setup to your production environment you won't regret it until it's too late. Vagrant makes it super simple to manage, set up, tear down, and distribute your dev environment. I highly recommend it, you can read more about it <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">here (http://www.vagrantup.com/)</a>.</p>
