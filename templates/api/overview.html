<h1>HighFin.js Overview</h1>
<p>Complete dev environment in a box - get started in 3 commands. We achieve this using <a href="http://vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a>. While you don't by any means need a VM to run the HighFin framework, we strongly encourage the use of VMs during development to ensure your dev, staging, and production environments are as similar as possible. The VM we supply focuses on letting devs get started with the framework fast, and integrating with the HighFin PaaS/SaaS seemlessly. If you're using the framework on your own infrastructure you should reconfigure Vagrant to suit your needs.</p>

<p>HighFin.js is designed to support multiple url schemes and code separation paradigms to be as flexible as possible.</p>

<p>Request routing and automatic form & post handling on both the server and client.</p>

<p>A Robust templating engine like no other that's new, refreshing, and easy to read. Switch, nest, and mix logic centric templates with markup heavy templates, and take advantage of automatic namespacing on both client and server.</p>

<p>Tested in real world apps with thousands of active users.</p>

<p>Helper functions that actually help with no extra work or changes to the way you code.</p>
