# Status
The framework is currently in active development and should be considered alpha/beta quality.

# Salmon - Lightning Fast Overview
Salmon is a flexible and configurable Javascript framework. Built on Node.js for building next generation apps, fast. The recommended workflow is to download the frybox (vagrant environment for maturing salmon apps) and setup an account on [HighF.in](http://highf.in) to take advantage of our seemless, dead-simple, and lightening fast dev-qa-deploy infrastructure.
